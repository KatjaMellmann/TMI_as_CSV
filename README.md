The digital text used for the csv file was downloaded from the online learning project:

It is an edited version of the text presented in the internet project:

I have no information about whether the digitization was based on the CD-ROM edition by the original publisher:

    Stith Thompson: Motif-Index of Folk-Literature. A Classification of Narrative Elements in Folktales, Ballads, Myths, Fables, Mediaeval Romances, Exempla, Fabliaux, Jestbooks, and Local Legends. CD-ROM. Bloomington, IN: Indiana University Press 1993.
    [Cf. Allen Smith: JAL Guide to Software, Courseware and CD-ROM. [Stith Thompson’s Motif-Index of Folk Literature. / Directory of Library Automation Sofware, & Services.] In: Journal of Academic Librarianship 20 (1994), no. 4, 255-256.]

A different digital version is currently being established at Wikisource:

    https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Motif-Index_of_Folk-Literature

As it will also include the cross-references (omitted in the above mentioned versions), future endeavors may prefer to use that one.

CSV FILE 
In building the present csv file, I have slightly edited the text. Specifically, I have

  * restored some special characters, and sporadically corrected errors where I came across them;
  * integrated the "Additions and Corrections" indicated at the end of vls. V & VI of the printed edition;
  * added footnotes of the printed edition (search string "[Note:").

Furthermore, I created two additional code fields/columns:

  * one in which Thompson's alpha-numeric codes are extended by "0"s as to be sortable in correct order in a "text" field definition;
  * another one indicating the equivalents in the first edition (including the "Additions and Corrections" in V 439-448).

The csv file is encoded as UTF-8 and deploys comma (,) as field separator and quotation marks (") as field surrounding.

    Latest version:

FURTHER NOTES

The primary purpose of the csv file is to generate a reference table within a relational database (of folklore or different kinds of datasets). 
It is not especially useful as a means to search for particular motifs. For that purpose, one might rather use the

    MOMFER - Meerten online motif finder, http://www.momfer.ml
    [Cf. Folgert Karsdorp, Marten van der Meulen, Theo Meder, Antal van den Bosch: MOMFER. A Search Engine of Thompson's Motif-Index of Folk Literature. In: Folklore 126 (2015), no. 1, 37–52. https://doi.org/10.1080/0015587X.2015.1006954 ]
